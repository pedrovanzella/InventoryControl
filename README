This project aims to provide a simple web interface to control inventory for small to medium businesses.
Currently it runs on Rails 2.3.5 and Ruby 1.8.7 and uses Formtastic to handle the complex model forms.

Very little functionality is in place right now, just some basic scaffolding for the models.

Feel free to contribute :)

TODO:
BETTER DO EARLY:
	* Upgrade to Rails 3.0 as soon as it's stable

ABSOLUTE BASICS:
	* When creating a new sale you should be able to modify the sale price (and it must be stored separate from the original price)
	* Same goes for purchase and the purchase price
	* The amount in the inventory must be increased/decreased when a product is sold / bought

GETTING FANCY:
	* Nice google-style autocompletion for names, no checkboxes or dropboxes on nested models
	* Good-looking front page
	
REPORTS:
	* Best buyers
	* Detailed inventory history for each product
		* How much sold by time
		* Price fluctuation
