This project aims to provide a simple web interface to control inventory for small to medium businesses.
Currently it runs on Rails 2.3.1 and Ruby 1.8.7, but I plan on upgrading to Rails 3 and Ruby 1.9.2.

Very little functionality is in place right now, just some basic scaffolding for the models (and some wrong named ones).
